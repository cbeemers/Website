                    <article class='me'>
                        <p>My name is Christopher Beeman and I am currently a junior (4th year) computer science major at Michigan State
                                University. Originally a mechanical engineering major, I was required to take a programming class my
                                sophomore (2nd) year that I ended up dedicating all my time to because of my desire to learn and complete the projects. 
                                My long-term goal is to become a self-sufficient programmer, however, 
                                right now I am unsure of what particular concentration of the computer science field I would like to 
                                work in. I started this project to learn new practices
                                outside of my CSE degree requirements and so far
                                I have taken courses teaching Python, C++, and some basic C, 
                                but I began learning HTML, JavaScript, and 
                                CSS over this past summer. Most of what I have programmed in JS and HTML are 
                                shown on display here. 
                                I want to learn more backend practices and overall how to 
                                work in the backend to communicate with
                                databases so I can create more dynamic webpages. To do this, my next planned project
                                is a fullstack JavaScript web application that will have many features with the most important
                                being user authentification and specific user capabilities. Since this website is mostly frontend, the next will be primarily 
                                backend to better familiarize myself in working with a database.

                                <br> JS is a language that I would like to spend more time learning because of its prevalence in the web dev field 
                                and constantly evolving uses.
