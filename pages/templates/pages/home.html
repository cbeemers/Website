                        <p>My name is Christopher Beeman and I am currently a 5th year computer science major at Michigan State
                                University. Originally a mechanical engineering major, I was required to take a programming class my
                                sophomore (2nd) year that I ended up dedicating all my time to because of my desire to learn more on the subject and complete the projects. 
                                My long-term goal is to become a self-sufficient programmer, however, 
                                right now I am unsure of what particular concentration of the computer science field I would like to 
                                work in. I started this project to learn new practices
                                outside of my CSE degree requirements and so far
                                I have taken courses teaching Python, C++, Java, and some basic C, 
                                but I began learning HTML, JavaScript, and 
                                CSS over the summer of 2019. 
                                <br> My primary reason for creating this website was to familiarize myself with web development for the first time, but has
                                evolved to be a resume of sorts as I look for an internship in the computer science field.
